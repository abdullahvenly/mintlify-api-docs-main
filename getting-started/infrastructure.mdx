## How Do We Do It at Venly?

### Web Authentication Service

Venly utilizes an identity provider and web authentication service as the initial layer of authentication. Users can authenticate using their email and password or via a social login, acquiring access to the developer portal. Clients' requests to Venly (web, browser extension, or mobile) must first be authenticated to gain access to credentials via the developer portal.

### Authentication via a Bearer Token

Next, the user must obtain a bearer token using their access credentials. The access credentials (**Client ID** and **Client Secret**) are obtained from the [authentication](https://portal.venly.io/authentication/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=General+-+Venly+Internal) section of the [developer portal](https://portal.venly.io/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=General+-+Venly+Internal). The bearer token is the user's entry for using API calls.

<Info>
**Token Validity:**
- The bearer token is only valid for **six minutes** and must be refreshed to obtain a new one
- Learn [how to authenticate](/getting-started/authentication) with Venly services

## Signing Methods

To this end, we implement an additional authorization layer called signing methods. These signing methods are only known to end-users and are used to unlock their wallets.

Every sensitive operation (for example, signing a transaction, initiating a transaction, or exporting a wallet) requires the end-user to authorize the request to perform that operation using their signing method.

We allow three types of signing methods:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="PIN" icon="lock">
    A six-digit pincode only known by the end-user
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Emergency Code" icon="key">
    A complex password that serves as a gateway to unlock a wallet or recover a lost PIN. It is 25 characters long and has a minimum of 128 bits of entropy
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Biometrics" icon="fingerprint">
    This signing method allows users to utilize biometric features such as Face ID or Touch ID for authentication
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Attack Mode

Attack mode can be activated/deactivated from the [authentication](https://portal.venly.io/authentication/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=General+-+Venly+Internal) section of the [portal](https://portal.venly.io/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=General+-+Venly+Internal).

Attack Mode is a critical security feature designed to safeguard your platform against potential security threats and unauthorized access. By activating Attack Mode, you can instantly halt all incoming traffic from your clients or servers to our system, ensuring your data and operations remain secure during a security incident.

Knowing that you have a reliable mechanism to stop potential threats allows you to respond confidently to security incidents. With a simple toggle, you can activate Attack Mode and ensure your system is protected.

### When to Use Attack Mode

### How to Monitor

Visit the [authentication](https://portal.venly.io/authentication) section of the [portal](https://portal.venly.io/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=General+-+Venly+Internal) and check the date, time, and IP address of each login event.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify Recognized IPs">
    Ensure that all logins are from recognized IP addresses and expected times
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Identify Suspicious Activity">
    Look for any login attempts from unknown IP addresses or at unusual times

## Shamir's Secret Sharing

A wallet's private key is divided into two shares: **user-owned share** and **application share**. These shares are further encrypted and stored in a key vault.

- The **user-owned share** can be decrypted using that user's signing method
- The **application share** is decrypted using the credentials: client ID and client secret

Both of these shares are combined and unlock an end user's wallet. If a malicious entity gains access to one of the two shares, it is practically useless for them, as both shares must be combined to gain access to a wallet.

<Info>
**How It Works:**

Shamir's Secret Sharing is a cryptographic algorithm that divides a secret into multiple parts. A minimum number of parts are needed to reconstruct the original secret. This ensures that no single party can access the wallet without the other share.
</Info>

---

## Isolated Generation of the Private Key

Venly uses Amazon Fargate to generate the private key of a wallet when required temporarily. With the Fargate launch type, you package your application into containers and specify how much CPU power and memory it needs. You also set up networking and security rules.

Each Fargate task runs in its own **isolated environment**, meaning it doesn't share its core resources—like CPU, memory, or network connection—with any other task. This ensures your application runs isolated and secure.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Isolated Environment" icon="box">
    Each task runs independently with dedicated resources
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Temporary Generation" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    Private keys are generated only when needed and not stored permanently
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Resource Allocation" icon="gauge-high">
    Configurable CPU and memory for optimal performance
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Network Security" icon="network-wired">
    Secured networking and firewall rules
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Segregated Model

Venly's offerings, namely the Wallet-API and Widget solutions, follow a segregated model, reflecting a commitment to providing users with a high level of individual control, security, and transparency in managing their digital assets.

Each user is treated as a separate and unique entity. Tokens are not pooled together, and the wallet's owner is the sole custodian of that wallet.

Under Venly's segregated accounts model, each user becomes the sole custodian of their wallet. This means that the ownership and control of the wallet's private keys rest entirely with the individual user.

<Info>
**Key Benefits:**
- Individual control over assets
- No commingling of funds
- Enhanced security through isolation
- Complete transparency in asset management
</Info>

## Clean and Simple Integration

Our service offerings are designed for easy implementation and seamless integration with your applications. We understand that an easy integration process is key to minimizing issues and maximizing efficiency. On the other hand, more complex integrations, such as the one required for MPC (Multi-Party Computation), can lead to increased challenges and potential vulnerabilities.

While MPC offers advanced security features, its integration process can be more involved, potentially leading to compatibility issues or vulnerabilities like the [Zero Day](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/09/fireblocks-discloses-zero-day-vulnerabilities-impacting-leading-mpc-wallets/) vulnerability.

<Tip>
Venly's straightforward integration approach reduces complexity while maintaining robust security standards.

## Encrypted Databases

Within Venly's framework, encryption isn't just an afterthought; it's a foundational principle of operations. Each piece of data stored within the databases is encrypted using robust encryption algorithms, rendering it indecipherable to anyone without the proper cryptographic keys.

This approach ensures that even if a malicious actor were to gain access to the database, the information would remain safely locked away, beyond their reach.

<Info>
**Encryption at Rest:**

All data is encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms, ensuring maximum protection even in the event of unauthorized access.
