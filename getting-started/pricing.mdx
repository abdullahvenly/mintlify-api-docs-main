# Pricing

Venly offers a flexible pay-as-you-go pricing model. Plans include a base fee that covers a predefined level of consumption. Once you exceed this base level, you continue with a pay-as-you-go approach, paying only for the additional services you use.

With Venly, you avoid long-term contracts and complex licensing, similar to paying for utilities like water and electricity: you only pay for what you consume. Additionally, you can choose between a **monthly license** or a **yearly license**, with the **yearly** option providing a **20% discount**.

## Pay as You Go!

The number of compute units are conveniently bundled in groups of 100K. The Professional plan includes **ten** bundles, while the Developer plan includes **two** bundles each containing **100K compute units**.

If you exceed your plan's compute unit limit (for instance, 1 Million), an additional bundle of 100K compute units will be automatically added and invoiced. If you surpass the extra 100K compute units, another 100K compute units will be added, invoiced, and so on. This ensures uninterrupted service while keeping you informed about your usage.

### Over Usage Pricing

| Plan | Additional 100K CUs |
|:-----|:--------------------|
| **Scale** | $17 |
| **Professional** | $25 |
| **Developer** | $62 |

<Info>
Over usage is always billed **monthly** regardless if you have a monthly or yearly plan.

## Compute Units

Compute units (CUs) are a way to measure how much computing resources, like processing power and memory, an API endpoint requires. Think of compute units like a measuring stick representing how much computer power an API endpoint needs. The more compute units an API endpoint requires, the more resources it consumes to complete the request and vice versa.

### Why Use Compute Units?

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### How Are Compute Units Calculated?

Some API endpoints are lightweight and fast to run (e.g., [Get a User](https://docs.venly.io/reference/getuser)) and others can be more intense (e.g., [Create Wallet](https://docs.venly.io/reference/createwallet)). Each API endpoint is assigned a quantity of compute units depending on the complexity of the endpoint request.

By the end of your billing cycle, all compute units are added and a total is created. This total of compute units is then used to create your invoice. You only pay for what you use, plain and simple. Your charges will be based on the volume of compute units consumed.

### Approximate Creations Per Plan

  <Tab title="Developer">
    **200,000 Compute Units**

    - Execute **40,000+** Transactions
    - Mint **40,000+** NFTs
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Endpoints and Their CUs

Below is a table of some main requests and their corresponding CU cost:

| Endpoint | CU Cost |
|:---------|:--------|
| Authenticate (fetch auth token) | 10 |
| Create a user | 50 |
| Get User by ID | 25 |
| Create a wallet | 75 |
| Get wallet balance | 25 |
| Perform a transaction | 75 |
| Read a smart contract | 25 |
| Mint an NFT | 75 |
| Update an NFT | 25 |
| Create a Payment Checkout link | 25 |
| Create a webhook | 25 |

### Basic Creation Endpoints and CU Cost

The table shows the compute unit cost for creating user wallets, executing transactions, and minting NFTs:

| API Request | CU Cost |
|:-----------|:--------|
| **Create a User Wallet** | 75 |
| Create 200 User Wallets | 15,000 |
| Create 1,000 User Wallets | 75,000 |
| **Execute a Transaction** | 75 |
| Execute 200 Transactions | 15,000 |
| Execute 1,000 Transactions | 75,000 |
| **Mint an NFT** | 75 |
| Mint 200 NFTs | 15,000 |
| Mint 1,000 NFTs | 75,000 |

## Optimizing Venly API Integration

<iframe
  src="https://www.loom.com/embed/f7c79a547a8643ada3d7b6df2fa85781?sid=74a2cff8-de13-45c2-8b8d-fae1d379410d"
  frameBorder="0"
  allowFullScreen
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    height: '400px'
  }}
/>

### Authentication Optimization

The expiration is in the token itself, so it would be better to read the expiry and only fetch a new token if it is expired. The bearer token is valid for approximately **6 minutes** after it is fetched. Only retrieve the bearer again when it is expired.

For example in JavaScript, this can be done with the help of [jwt-decode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jwt-decode):

```javascript
import jwtDecode from 'jwt-decode';

const isTokenExpired = (token) => {
  if (!token) return true;
  try {
    const decodedToken = jwtDecode(token);
    const currentTime = Date.now() / 1000;
    return decodedToken.exp < currentTime;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error decoding token:', error);
    return true;
  }
};
```

<Tip>
**Savings:** Check token expiration before fetching a new one to avoid unnecessary authentication requests (10 CUs per auth).
</Tip>

### Creating Users Efficiently

The create user endpoint uses 50 CUs and allows you to create one user. To use this endpoint efficiently, you can create a signing method for the user while you are creating the user. This way only 50 CUs are used and you can create a user and their signing method simultaneously.

When creating a user you can specify the request body as:

```json
{
  "reference": "Test User 1",
  "signingMethod": {
    "type": "PIN",
    "value": "123456"
  }
}
```

<Tip>
**Savings:** Create user + signing method in one call (50 CUs) instead of two separate calls (50 + 50 = 100 CUs).
</Tip>

### Minting NFTs in Batches

The mint NFT endpoint uses 75 CUs. You can mint multiple NFTs to multiple wallet addresses/email addresses with the same endpoint. This means you will only utilize 75 CUs and can mint multiple NFTs to multiple wallets/emails.

  Learn how to batch mint NFTs to multiple destinations
</Card>

<Tip>
**Savings:** Batch mint 10 NFTs to different wallets in one call (75 CUs) instead of 10 separate calls (750 CUs).
</Tip>

## How Will I Be Billed?

Billing depends on the plan you have selected and the compute units consumed.

Compute units are bundled in bundles of **100K** (100,000). This means the **Professional Plan** includes **ten bundles**, while the **Developer Plan** includes **two bundles** of **100K** compute units.

As soon as you surpass the compute units included in your plan, an additional bundle of **100K** will automatically be added and invoiced.

### Over Usage Charges

- On the **Scale plan**, over usage will be charged by **$17** for an additional 100k compute units
- On the **Professional plan**, over usage will be charged by **$25** for an additional 100k compute units
- On the **Developer plan**, over usage will be charged by **$62** for an additional 100k compute units
