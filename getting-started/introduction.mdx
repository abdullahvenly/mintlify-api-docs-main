# Platform Overview

The Venly platform contains three pillars: **Digital Wallets**, **Digital Assets**, and **Payments**.

## Digital Wallets

Secure and scalable SSS-based wallets with robust non-custodian key management for digital assets. The Venly security protocol redefines private key security, never gathering a private key as one whole, eliminating risk.

Venly customers use our wallets for various operations, such as:
- Treasury management
- Trading operations
- Cold storage
- Royalty management
- NFT operations
- Smart contract interactions
- User wallet services
- Other digital asset management

<Info>
We provide two distinct Wallet-as-a-Service (WaaS) products: the **Widget** and the **Wallet-API**. While one features a user interface, the other is a dedicated API.
