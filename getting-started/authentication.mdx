# Authentication

Authentication is a crucial process that ensures only authorized users or applications can access resources. It involves verifying the identity of the entity attempting to access the system. Proper authentication is essential for maintaining the security and integrity of your system and its data.

This page explains the **different types of authentication** required for **different Venly components**.

---

## Authenticating with Venly

Venly services are categorized into two main parts, each with its own authentication method:

### 1. API Services (OAuth 2.0)

The **API** category includes:
- **Wallet-API** - Wallet management and blockchain operations
- **NFT-API** - NFT creation and management
- **PAY-API** - Payment and checkout services

These API components are authenticated via **OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow**.

### 2. Widget (Client ID + URLs)

The **Widget** is a **JavaScript SDK** that uses a different authentication method. It is authenticated using:
- **Client ID**
- **Valid redirect URLs** (whitelisted domains)

## Attack Mode

<Warning>
**Security Feature**

Attack Mode can be activated/deactivated from the [authentication](https://portal.venly.io/authentication/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=General+-+Venly+Internal) section of the [portal](https://portal.venly.io/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=General+-+Venly+Internal).
</Warning>

Attack Mode is a critical security feature designed to safeguard your platform against potential security threats and unauthorized access. By activating Attack Mode, you can instantly halt all incoming traffic from your clients or servers to our system, ensuring your data and operations remain secure during a security incident.

### Why Use Attack Mode?

Knowing that you have a reliable mechanism to stop potential threats allows you to respond confidently to security incidents. With a simple toggle, you can activate Attack Mode and ensure your system is protected.
