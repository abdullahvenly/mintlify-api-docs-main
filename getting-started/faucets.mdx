# What is a Faucet

A blockchain faucet is a service that gives out small amounts of cryptocurrency for freeâ€”like a faucet dripping drops of crypto instead of water.

---

## Why Are Faucets Important

Testnet cryptocurrency provides a safe, risk-free environment for blockchain development and experimentation. It allows developers to test applications and smart contracts without using real cryptocurrencies. This enables exploration of our products and experimentation with various features and configurations using testnet tokens, without risking real assets or affecting the mainnet.

## Testnets vs Mainnets

Testnets and mainnets serve distinct purposes in blockchain development:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Mainnet">
    **Production Environment**
    - Handles real-world transactions
    - Uses real cryptocurrencies
    - Transactions have real financial value
    - Production-ready applications
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Testnet">
    **Testing Environment**
    - Safe, risk-free environment
    - Uses testnet tokens (no real value)
    - Free tokens available from faucets
    - Ideal for development and testing
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
This is where a testnet faucet comes in, a service that distributes testnet tokens for free, allowing developers to access the necessary testing resources.
</Info>

Using testnet tokens, developers can experiment with applications, smart contracts, and our APIs without risking real assets or impacting the mainnet. This controlled environment ensures the stability and reliability of applications before they go live.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Dedicated Test Wallets" icon="wallet">
    Create separate wallets specifically for testing to avoid confusion with your production wallets and to better track your testing activities.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Plan Your Testing" icon="clipboard-list">
    Since faucets have rate limits (typically 24 hours), plan your testing activities accordingly to ensure you have enough tokens when needed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Check Testnet Status" icon="signal">
    Before requesting tokens, verify that the testnet is operational and not undergoing maintenance to avoid wasting your daily request.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Keep Track of Addresses" icon="address-book">
    Maintain a list of your testnet wallet addresses for different blockchains to streamline the token request process.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitor Token Balances" icon="chart-line">
    Regularly check your testnet token balances to ensure you have sufficient funds for your testing needs.
