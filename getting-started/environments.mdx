# Environments

Depending on which environment your application is connecting to, your blockchain transactions will be directed to a specific blockchain network. Below is an overview of the different endpoints and the associated blockchain networks.

## Blockchain Networks

The sandbox environment is your playground. It connects to testnet blockchains, meaning no real cryptocurrency and NFTs are involved. You can use [testnet faucets](https://docs.venly.io/docs/faucets) to receive cryptocurrency or to generate NFTs.

## EVM Explained

<Tip>
Understanding EVM is crucial for blockchain development across multiple chains.
</Tip>

The **Ethereum Virtual Machine** or **EVM** is like a powerful, decentralized computer that helps people do things on the Ethereum network, and its actions are recorded on the blockchain for everyone to see and agree upon. EVM is a platform for smart contract deployment and execution.

The Ethereum Virtual Machine serves as a software platform enabling developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum network. All Ethereum accounts and smart contracts exist on this virtual machine.

### Key Features of EVM

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Decentralized Execution" icon="network-wired">
    Code runs on thousands of nodes worldwide, ensuring no single point of failure
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Deterministic" icon="equals">
    Same input always produces the same output, ensuring consistency across the network
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Isolated Environment" icon="shield">
    Smart contracts run in isolation, protecting the network from malicious code
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Gas-Based" icon="gas-pump">
    Operations cost "gas" to prevent spam and infinite loops
  </Card>

## What are EVM Compatible Blockchains?

**EVM compatible blockchains** refers to the blockchains on which you can write and deploy smart contracts that are compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

Compatibility with the EVM enables numerous blockchains such as **Polygon**, **Avalanche**, and **Binance Smart Chain** to reduce the entry barrier for developers. This is possible because their native codes align with **Ethereum**, allowing seamless deployment of smart contracts on these new chains.

### Benefits of EVM Compatibility

## Environment Best Practices

<Warning>
**Important Guidelines**

Always test thoroughly in sandbox before deploying to production.
</Warning>

### Development Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with Sandbox">
    Begin development and testing in the sandbox environment using testnet chains
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Get Test Tokens">
    Use [testnet faucets](https://docs.venly.io/docs/faucets) to obtain free test tokens for your testing needs
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Thorough Testing">
    Test all functionality, edge cases, and error handling in sandbox
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Security Audit">
    Review and audit your code before production deployment
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Production Deployment">
    Deploy to production only after successful sandbox testing
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor & Maintain">
    Continuously monitor your production application and keep sandbox in sync for testing updates
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Security Recommendations

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Separate Credentials" icon="key">
    Always use different API credentials for sandbox and production environments
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Test Transactions" icon="vial">
    Never test with real funds - always use testnet tokens in sandbox
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Environment Variables" icon="file-code">
    Use environment variables to manage endpoint URLs and switch between environments
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Version Control" icon="code-branch">
    Keep separate configuration files for each environment in version control
  </Card>
