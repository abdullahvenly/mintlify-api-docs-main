<Info>
**Venly NFT API** provides a comprehensive set of endpoints for developers to streamline the creation, management, and distribution of NFTs with the ability to query NFT-related information based on contracts or wallet addresses.
</Info>

## What is the NFT API?

The Venly NFT API offers endpoints that allow you to manage your own collection of standardized blockchain NFTs. You can create collections and create cool NFTs with pictures and animations on different blockchains. Plus, you can send these NFTs straight to your users' wallets.

It is not limited to creating your own NFTs, as it also allows discovering which NFTs are stored in a wallet, and fetching the metadata not only of the NFT itself but also of the NFT contract.

You now can mint **dynamic NFTs**, marking the end of static, unchanging digital assets. Creators can now infuse their NFTs with dynamic elements that evolve, respond to external triggers, and offer a new level of engagement for collectors and end-users.
