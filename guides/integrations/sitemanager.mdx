# Introduction

Build websites with SiteManager, a zero-code platform that allows you to create and modify every detail of your website. 

With the Venly integration, you can create custom NFT websites allowing end-users to purchase and mint NFTs directly from your website. Reach a global audience by leveraging the fiat payment solution: Venly Pay. Directly mint NFTs as your end-users purchase them (_eliminating pre-minting_).

The Venly integration comes with a ready-to-use template. You can use the template, opt for a custom website design, or add the integration to your existing website.
