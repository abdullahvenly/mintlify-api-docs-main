# Getting up and running with Venly Widget

In this guide, we will walk through the steps required to start with the native integration of the Widget. 

> üìò **NOTE:**
> 
> - In this guide, we will be integrating the widget natively. 
> - All of the steps will be performed on [JS Fiddles](https://jsfiddle.net/).
> - We will work with sandbox credentials.
> - All functions will be performed on sandbox environment.

## Prerequisites

1. Your Widget **Client ID** (_Can be obtained from the [Developer Portal](https://portal.venly.io/authentication/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=General+-+Venly+Internal)_)
2. Finished [configuring the Widget](doc:configuration)

## Authenticating the Widget

To communicate with Venly, a **Client ID** is required along with whitelisted domains, from which you can perform the widget calls.

> üìò [Learn more about Widget authentication](https://docs.venly.io/docs/widget-authentication)

## Initializing/Including the Widget

### Step 1: Including the widget

When running on the JS Fiddle, you can add the following code in your HTML to include the Widget:

```html
<head>
    <title>Venly Widget</title>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/@venly/connect"></script>
    <!--Including the widget-->
</head>
```

> üìò [Including the Widget in a JavaScript Framework](https://docs.venly.io/docs/initializing-widget#step-1-including-the-widget)

### Step 2: Initializing the Widget, with Venly Connect

Create a `VenlyConnect` instance with your **Client ID** with the following script. Your Venly **Client ID** is required when calling this function, as it identifies your app to Venly. We have also specified the sandbox environment here.

```javascript
const venlyConnect = new VenlyConnect('your_client_id', {
  environment: 'sandbox'
}); 
```

The `VenlyConnect` object is your entry point to the rest of the widget functionalities.

### Step 3: Getting the basics ready

Following is a JS Fiddle whose code you can easily copy and try yourself. We have added HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. Following is a brief explanation of the code:

#### HTML:

- Included the widget in a `<script>`
- Added image URL of the Venly logo (_You can replace this with your own_)
- Created a button called **Connect with Widget** (_`getAccount()` function will be added later_)
- Created a `<textarea>` to display the response
- Added basic `h1`, `h2`, and `body` tags

#### CSS:

- Copy the CSS code as it is (_You can make changes according to your company color scheme_)

#### JavaScript

- Initialized the Widget with a **`Testaccount` Client Id** (_add your own Client Id here_) and set the environment as **sandbox**
- Created a function that will output the response of the function calls in a human-readable manner

## Connecting with Widget

Now let's learn how your end-user will connect with the widget. 

- Defined a constant called `chain` and set the value as **MATIC**. You can pick from the list of other chains we support. All the functions and wallet creations will happen on our selected **MATIC** chain.
- Added a `getAccount()` function which will allow your end-user to quickly sign in or sign up if they don't have an account. 
- Added the `getProfile()` function which will fetch your end-user profile details.
- Added the `logOut()` function to log out the currently logged-in user.
- In the HTML section, we created and assigned the relevant buttons.

> üìò - Replace the `Testaccount` with your **Client Id**.
> - Try the JS Fiddle yourself.

## Creating Wallets

Next, let's see how to create wallets. Since you are currently using the sandbox environment, the wallets will be created on a testnet chain. 

In this next fiddle, we have:

- Added the `manageWallets()` function that accepts the `chain` variable (_we previously defined the `chain` constant and assigned it `MATIC` value_).
- The `manageWallets()` function allows your users to connect existing wallets with your app, or create new wallets.
- Added the `getWallets()` function which will fetch all of your user's wallets. (_this function will fetch details for all your user's wallets including the wallet `address`_)
- In the HTML section, we created and assigned the relevant buttons.

> üìò - Try the fiddle yourself and create 2 wallets.
> - Next try the **Get All Wallets** to view your wallets.

### Example as a new user

- Using the Fiddle, first, connect your account.
- Next, click on **Manage Wallets**, and a pop-up will appear.
- You can either sign in or sign up using the provided options.
- Click on **Create new wallet**.
- Enter your **6-digit PIN** for the wallet and click **Submit**. Confirm the PIN again.
- Next, it is mandatory to enable an emergency code that can be used for PIN resets.
- Copy the emergency code and save it somewhere safe. Click continue.
- Your new wallet will be created! 
- Do this again to create a second wallet.

### Example as an existing user

- Using the Fiddle, first, connect your account.
- Next, click on **Manage Wallets**, and a pop-up will appear.
- You can also view and connect your existing wallets.
- Scroll to the bottom and click on **Create new wallet**.
- Enter your **6-digit PIN** for the wallet and click **Submit**.
- Your new wallet will be created! 
- Do this again to create a second wallet.

You now have two wallets on the Polygon (_MATIC_) testnet blockchain. Let's explore how to add testnet tokens to your wallet using the [Polygon Amoy Faucet](https://docs.venly.io/docs/faucets#faucet-for-venly-developers).

> üìò Learn more about [testnet tokens and Faucets](https://docs.venly.io/docs/faucets).

## Topping Up Wallet

To request tokens from the Venly Faucet, you need to follow these steps:

1. Go to Venly's [Developer Portal](https://portal-staging.venly.io/wallet-api/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=General+-+Venly+Internal) and navigate to **[Faucet](https://portal.venly.io/faucet/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=General+-+Venly+Internal)**. 
2. Choose the token you want to request, in this case, choose **MATIC**.
3. Enter your **wallet address** or **wallet UUID** associated with Venly. This ensures that the tokens are sent to the correct wallet
4. Click on the "Request tokens" button to submit your request. Tokens will be sent to your wallet shortly after.

![Request MATIC testnet tokens](https://files.readme.io/9b3d0da-image.png)


> üìò Now you should have some MATIC tokens in your first wallet while your second wallet is empty.

## Execute Crypto Transfer

Next, we will see how to execute a crypto transaction where we will send tokens from your first wallet to the second wallet.

In the next fiddle, we have:

- Added an `executeTransfer()` function that will carry out the transfer of tokens from your first wallet to the second. It accepts the following fields:
  - **`walletId`**: The `walletId` of the wallet executing the transaction (_first wallet_)
  - **`to`**: The recipients wallet address (_second wallet_)
  - **`value`**: Amount of tokens to transfer
  - **`secretType`**: The blockchain of the transaction (_in this case, MATIC_)
- Added the `getBalance()` function which fetches the balance of a wallet by `walletId`.
- In the HTML section, we created and assigned the relevant buttons.

<iframe src="https://jsfiddle.net/abdullah066/87pf5nz2/embedded/" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0"></iframe>


### Example

- Click on the **Get All Wallets** button and copy the respective data required for the `executeTransfer()` function.
- Modify the data for the `executeTransfer()` function. 
- Modify the `walletId` for the `getBalance()` function by adding the `walletId` of the **second** **wallet**.
- **Save** and **run** the fiddle again. Connect with the widget and click on **Get Balance**, in the result the `balance` field will be 0.
- Now click on **Execute Transfer**:
  - A pop-up will appear.
  - Confirm the details of the transaction and click **Submit**.
  - Enter your 6-digit PIN and click **Submit**.
  - You will see **Sign successful** message and the pop-up will close.

![Executing Crypto Transaction](https://files.readme.io/cc46182-Untitled_video_-_Made_with_Clipchamp_4.gif)


- Copy and save the `transactionHash` that you get in the **response body**. 
- Next, click on the **Get Balance** again and the `balance` of your second wallet will be >0.
- Alternatively, you can also check the status of the transaction by pasting the `transactionHash` on the [Polygon Testnet Explorer](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/) (_in case of MATIC_).

![Checking the status of a Matic transaction on polygonscan.com](https://files.readme.io/aab2254-Sarari_-_Dark_1.png)


> üëç From the **Get Balance** you can confirm that your very first transaction was successful.
