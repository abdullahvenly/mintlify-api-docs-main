# Widget

Venly Widget is a powerful javascript SDK meticulously crafted to streamline common blockchain tasks. Its purpose is to enable functionalities that would otherwise be restricted due to security implications, such as creating signatures. By encapsulating Venly's extensive capabilities within a user-friendly JavaScript layer, Venly Widget effortlessly empowers developers and simplifies the development process.

> 📘 If you are new to Web3 and don't have experience with blockchain technologies, we recommend you use the Venly Widget natively for a better developer experience.

## Look and feel

As the Widget is a product that incorporates a user interface (UI), let's take a closer look at how some of the more regular flows would appear for an end user.

### Token Transfer

In this flow, the application prompts the user to transfer a token from their wallet to a different destination.
