## Step 1: Including the widget

Venly Connect has been published to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@venly/connect). So by using npm, you can fetch it by executing the following:

```
npm i @venly/connect
```

You can also download it directly via [UNPKG CDN](https://unpkg.com/@venly/connect).

> 📘 🧙 It is best to point Venly Connect to a specific version when including its URL in your code. See [https://unpkg.com/](https://unpkg.com/) for more info.

## Step 2: Initializing the widget, with Venly Connect

Create a VenlyConnect instance with your **Client ID **with the following script. Your Venly **Client ID** is required when calling this function, as it identifies your app to Venly.

```javascript
const venlyConnect = new VenlyConnect('Testaccount'); 
```

The `VenlyConnect` object is your entry point to the rest of the widget functionalities, below is its signature. You can connect to [several networks and environments](https://venly.readme.io/docs/environment-sandbox-production) by using the [`ConstructorOption`](https://venly.readme.io/docs/constructoroptions) '**Environment**'. 

```javascript
//Signature VenlyConnect
VenlyConnect(clientID:string, options?: ConstructorOptions)
```
