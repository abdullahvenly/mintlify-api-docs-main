# Call a contract

A contract call is the equivalent to launching a blockchain transaction. We've already covered that we can't execute a transaction without the user's approval. Therefore to be able to call a contract we will need to do two things i) define the contract call and ii) ask the user for his approval.

The object that can ask the user for his approval is called a [`Signer`](https://venly.readme.io/docs/signer), once we've created a `Signer` object we can use the `Signer` to perform the contract call.

> ðŸš§ To perform actions on a wallet , such as transactions or signatures,** the wallet has to be linked to your application**.  The easiest way to link a wallet to your application in to use **[getAccount](https://docs.venly.io/docs/widget-user-authentication#get-user-account)** flow.  The benefits of using the getAccount flow is that this flow bundles multiple actions into one call.

### Function:

```javascript
//Asking the signer to transfer a certain value to a certain destination.
venlyConnect.signer.executeContract({
    secretType: '<BLOCKCHAIN>',
    walletId: '<WALLET_ID>',
    to: '<BLOCKCHAIN ADDRESS>',
    value: 0,
    functionName: '<CONTRACT_FUNCTION_NAME>',
    inputs: [
      {type: "address", value: "0x80cbb6c4342948e5be81987dce8251dbedd69138"},
      {type: "uint256", value: "73680000"}
    ]
})
```

### Example:

```javascript
venlyConnect.signer.executeContract({
    secretType: 'ETHEREUM',
    walletId: '71dec640-4eb8-4321-adb8-b79461573fc4',
    to: '0xf147cA0b981C0CD0955D1323DB9980F4B43e9FED',
    value: 0,
    functionName: 'transfer',
    inputs: [
      {type: "address", value: "0x80cbb6c4342948e5be81987dce8251dbedd69138"},
      {type: "uint256", value: "73680000"}
    ]
})
```

### Returns:

```javascript
{
  status: "SUCCESS",
  result: {
    id: "046b6c74-e681-4398-a932-546c8c25034d",
    transactionHash: "0x7889109ae7a929a968f1d86a6efe396129d1f72a6df574a051516ef247e8a616"
  }
}
```
