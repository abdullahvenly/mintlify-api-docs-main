# Intro

It is not possible to transfer value from a wallet without the approval of the user. Therefore to be able to transfer a token, we will need to do two things: i) create the transfer and ii) ask the user for his approval.

The object that can ask the user for his approval is called a [`Signer`](https://venly.readme.io/docs/signer), once we've created a `Signer` object we can use the `Signer` to perform the token transfer.

> ðŸš§ To perform actions on a wallet , such as transactions or signatures,** the wallet has to be linked to your application**.  The easiest way to link a wallet to your application in to use **[getAccount](https://docs.venly.io/docs/widget-user-authentication#get-user-account)** flow.  The benefits of using the getAccount flow is that this flow bundles multiple actions into one call.

### Function:

```javascript
//Asking the signer to transfer a certain value to a certain destination.
venlyConnect.signer.executeNftTransfer({
    walletId: '<WALLET_ID>',
    to: '<BLOCKCHAIN ADDRESS>',
    tokenAddress: '<TOKEN_BLOCKCHAIN ADDRESS>',
    tokenId: '<TOKEN_ID>',
    secretType: '<BLOCKCHAIN>',
})
```

### Example:

#### Address

```javascript
const venlyConnect = new VenlyConnect('YOUR_CLIENT_ID'); 

//Asking the signer to transfer NFT token to a blockchain address.
venlyConnect.signer.executeNftTransfer({
    walletId: '71dec640-4eb8-4321-adb8-b79461573fc4',
    to: '0xf147cA0b981C0CD0955D1323DB9980F4B43e9FED',
    tokenAddress: '0x158b6a3540eeced8ecb40f9389e88f0902a3da9f'
    tokenId: '65'
    secretType: 'ETHEREUM',

})
```

#### Email

```javascript
const venlyConnect = new VenlyConnect('YOUR_CLIENT_ID'); 

//Asking the signer to transfer NFT tokens to an email address
venlyConnect.signer.executeNftTransfer({
    walletId: '71dec640-4eb8-4321-adb8-b79461573fc4',
    to: 'john.smith@gmail.com',
    tokenAddress: '0x158b6a3540eeced8ecb40f9389e88f0902a3da9f'
    tokenId: '65'
    secretType: 'ETHEREUM',

})
```

> ðŸ“˜ The destination of a token transfer is not limited to a blockchain address, we also support **email addresses** and [Unstoppable domains](https://unstoppabledomains.com/).

### Returns:

```javascript
{
  status: "SUCCESS",
  result: {
    id: "046b6c74-e681-4398-a932-546c8c25034d",
