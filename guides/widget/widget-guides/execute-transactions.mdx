# Introduction

It is not possible to execute a transaction from a wallet without the approval of the user. Therefore to be able to transfer a token, we will need to do two things: i) create the transfer and ii) ask the user for his approval.

The object that can ask the user his approval is called a [`Signer`](https://venly.readme.io/docs/signer), once we've created a `Signer` object we can use the `Signer` to perform a transaction.

> ðŸš§ To perform actions on a wallet , such as transactions or signatures,** the wallet has to be linked to your application**.  The easiest way to link a wallet to your application in to use **[getAccount](https://docs.venly.io/docs/widget-user-authentication#get-user-account)** flow.  The benefits of using the getAccount flow is that this flow bundles multiple actions into one call.

### Function:

```javascript
//Asking the signer to transfer a certain value to a certain destination.
venlyConnect.signer.executeTransfer({
    walletId: '<WALLET_ID>',
    to: '<BLOCKCHAIN ADDRESS>',
    value: 3.1415,
    secretType: '<BLOCKCHAIN>',
    data: '0x<encoded_function>'
})
```

> ðŸ“˜ Using the **`data`** attribute, you can pass in any encoded function call

### Example:

#### Address

```javascript
const venlyConnect = new VenlyConnect('YOUR_CLIENT_ID'); 

//Asking the signer to transfer to a blockchain address.
venlyConnect.signer.executeTransfer({
    walletId: 'c8ec9954-fa1a-4682-9cf8-ef5c1015d1d1',
    to: '0xf147cA0b981C0CD0955D1323DB9980F4B43e9FED',
    value: 0,
    secretType: 'ETHEREUM',
    data: '0x'
})
```

#### Email

```javascript
const venlyConnect = new VenlyConnect('YOUR_CLIENT_ID'); 

//Asking the signer to transfer to an email address.
venlyConnect.signer.executeTransfer({
    walletId: '71dec640-4eb8-4321-adb8-b79461573fc4',
    to: 'john.smith@gmail.com',
    value: 0.01415,
    secretType: 'ETHEREUM',
})
```

> ðŸ“˜ ðŸ§™ The destination of a transfer is not limited to a blockchain address, we also support **email addresses** and [Unstoppable domains](https://unstoppabledomains.com/).

### Returns:

```javascript
{
  status: "SUCCESS",
  result: {
    id: "9d4c550d-78b2-4e9d-850c-d376f198293c",
    transactionHash: "0xcf8b99b7a11decd5b650c48435632c0e0a7b8b01f382addfd5932fdfa6d9ee62"
  }
}
```
