The `Signer` allows the user to sign or execute a transaction. Consider a Signer as the approval of the user. In order for the user the give his approval he requires to enter his PIN. A `Signer` will enable him to do so. 

> ğŸ“˜ If you are using the popup signer and you want to execute a transaction as a reaction to an event (e.g. a button click), then call `venlyConnect.createSigner(â€¦â€‹)` as very first in your event handler otherwise, the popup might get blocked by the popup blocker of the browser.

## closePopup

When using the POPUP [`WindowMode`](https://venly.readme.io/docs/windowmode) you can close the `Signer`popup manually in case something went wrong. You can use the code snippet below to close it. The type guard, isnâ€™t mandatory, but it makes the code more robust.

```javascript
if (venlyConnect.isPopupSigner(signer)) {
    signer.closePopup();
}
```
