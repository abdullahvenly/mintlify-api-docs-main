## Overview

The **Web3Modal** SDK simplifies the process of connecting your Web3 decentralized application (dApp) with wallets. It offers a straightforward and user-friendly interface for dApps to request actions, including signing transactions and interacting with smart contracts on the blockchain.

### Initialization:

```javascript
explorerRecommendedWalletIds = [
  'a21d06c656c8b1de253686e06fc2f1b3d4aa39c46df2bfda8a6cc524ef32c20c'
];

const web3Modal = new Web3Modal({
  explorerRecommendedWalletIds
});
```

> ðŸ“˜ When you plan to build our own wallet based on our **Wallet API**, we suggest to read: [How to integrate with WalletConnect](doc:how-to-integrate-with-walletconnect).
