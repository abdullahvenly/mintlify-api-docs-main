## Important Considerations

### Market Risk
- APY rates fluctuate with market conditions
- Returns not guaranteed
- Principal value can vary slightly

### Smart Contract Risk
- Despite audits, bugs can exist
- Use only well-established protocols
- Consider insurance when available

### Liquidity Risk
- Some vaults may have withdrawal delays
- During high demand, withdrawals may be slower
- Plan accordingly

<Warning>
  DeFi investments carry risks. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results.
</Warning>

## Tax Implications

<Note>
  Yield earnings may be taxable in your jurisdiction. Consult a tax professional for advice specific to your situation.
