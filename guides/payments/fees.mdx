## Overview

Fundflow applies fees to both on-ramp and off-ramp transactions. Fees are **company-specific** and may include volume-based tiers to provide better rates for higher transaction volumes.

## Fee Structure

### How Fees Work

Fees are calculated as a **percentage** of the transaction amount and are deducted from the total:

- **On-Ramp**: Fee is deducted from the fiat amount before conversion
- **Off-Ramp**: Fee is deducted from the crypto amount before conversion

### Fee Components

Each ramp request includes detailed fee information:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Fiat Amount** | Total fiat amount (including fees) |
| **Fiat Net Amount** | Net fiat after deducting fees |
| **Crypto Amount** | Cryptocurrency amount |
| **Fiat Fee Amount** | Fee amount in fiat currency |
| **Fee Percentage** | Percentage rate applied |
| **Exchange Rate** | Conversion rate used |

## Calculating Fees

### Using the API

Use the [Calculate Fee](/api-reference/Fundflow-API/fees/calculate-fee-for-a-ramp-request) endpoint to determine fees before creating a ramp request:

```bash
POST /v1/fees/calculate
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "amount": 1000.00,
  "type": "ON_RAMP"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "result": {
    "amount": 10.00,
    "percentage": 1.0
  }
}
```

### Calculation Examples

#### On-Ramp Example (1% fee)

```
Fiat Amount (sent by customer):     €1,000.00
Fee (1%):                            €10.00
Net Amount (converted to crypto):    €990.00
Exchange Rate:                       1 USDC = €1.00
Crypto Received:                     990 USDC
```

#### Off-Ramp Example (1% fee)

```
Crypto Amount (sent by customer):    1,000 USDC
Fee (1%):                            10 USDC
Net Amount (converted to fiat):      990 USDC
Exchange Rate:                       1 USDC = €1.00
Fiat Received:                       €990.00
```

## Volume Tiers

### Tiered Pricing

Companies may have volume-based fee tiers that provide lower rates for higher transaction volumes:

| Tier | Volume Range | Fee Percentage |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| **Tier 1** | €0 - €10,000 | 1.5% |
| **Tier 2** | €10,001 - €50,000 | 1.0% |
| **Tier 3** | €50,001+ | 0.75% |

<Note>
  Fee tiers are configured per company. Contact Venly to discuss custom pricing for your business needs.
</Note>

### Viewing Your Fee Configuration

Use the [Get Company Fee Configuration](/api-reference/Fundflow-API/fees/get-company-fee-configuration) endpoint:

```bash
GET /v1/fees
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "result": [
    {
      "id": "fee-tier-1-id",
      "companyId": "your-company-id",
      "name": "Standard Tier",
      "type": "ON_RAMP",
      "minVolume": 0,
      "maxVolume": 10000,
      "percentage": 1.5,
      "version": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "fee-tier-2-id",
      "companyId": "your-company-id",
      "name": "Volume Tier",
      "type": "ON_RAMP",
      "minVolume": 10001,
      "maxVolume": 50000,
      "percentage": 1.0,
      "version": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

## Fee Application

### When Fees Are Applied

Fees are applied at different stages depending on the ramp type:

**On-Ramp:**
1. Customer sends fiat to Venly deposit account
2. Fee is deducted from the fiat amount
3. Net amount is converted to crypto at current exchange rate
4. Crypto is sent to company wallet

**Off-Ramp:**
1. Customer sends crypto to Venly deposit wallet
2. Fee is deducted from the crypto amount
3. Net amount is converted to fiat at current exchange rate
4. Fiat is sent to company bank account

### Fee Transparency

All fee information is clearly displayed in the ramp request:

```json
{
  "id": "ramp-request-id",
  "rampType": "ON_RAMP",
  "fiatAmount": 1000.00,
  "fiatNetAmount": 990.00,
  "fiatFeeAmount": 10.00,
  "feePercentage": 1.0,
  "cryptoAmount": 990.00,
  "exchangeRate": 1.0,
  ...
}
```

## Exchange Rates

### How Rates Are Determined

Exchange rates are determined at the time of conversion and reflect current market conditions:

- Rates are sourced from reliable market data providers
- Rates include a small spread to account for market volatility
- Rates are locked when the transaction enters PROCESSING status

### Rate Visibility

The exchange rate used for each transaction is included in the ramp request details:

```bash
GET /v1/ramp-requests/{id}
```

```json
{
  "exchangeRate": 1.0012,
  "fiatAmount": 1000.00,
  "cryptoAmount": 998.80,
  ...
}
```

<Note>
  Exchange rates may fluctuate between request creation and processing. The final rate is determined when the payment is received and conversion begins.
</Note>

## Best Practices

### Before Creating Requests

<Tip>
  **Calculate Fees First**: Always use the fee calculation endpoint before creating large ramp requests to understand the total cost.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Check Volume Tiers**: If you're close to a tier threshold, consider batching transactions to benefit from lower fees.
</Tip>

### Optimizing Costs

<Tip>
  **Batch Transactions**: Combine multiple smaller transactions into larger ones to potentially benefit from volume tier pricing.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Plan Ahead**: Schedule large transactions during periods of lower market volatility to minimize exchange rate risk.
</Tip>

### Transparency

<Tip>
  **Review Breakdowns**: Always review the complete fee and amount breakdown before approving ramp requests.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Export Records**: Use the export functionality to maintain detailed records for accounting and tax purposes.
</Tip>
