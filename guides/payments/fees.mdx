## Overview

Venly FundFlow Prime uses a transparent, volume-based pricing model with no hidden fees.

<Info>
  All fees are shown upfront before you confirm any transaction. What you see is what you pay.
</Info>

## Stablecoin Transfers

For transfers without currency conversion (e.g., USDC to USDC):

<Card title="Flat Rate" icon="percent">
  **0.10%** for both on-ramp and off-ramp
  
  This applies when there's no foreign exchange conversion needed.
</Card>

**Example**: Converting €10,000 to €10,000 worth of USDC
- Fee: €10 (0.10%)
- You receive: €9,990 worth of USDC

## Tiered Fee Structure

For transactions with currency conversion, fees depend on:
1. **Currency tier** (based on liquidity and market)
2. **Monthly transaction volume**

### Currency Tiers

| Tier | Currencies | Volume: $0-10M | Volume: $10M-50M | Volume: $50M+ |
|------|-----------|----------------|------------------|---------------|

| **Tier 2** | AED, SGD, HKD, MXN, BRL, PKR, ZAR | 0.55% | 0.50% | 0.45% |
| **Tier 3** | Frontier Currencies | 0.70% | 0.65% | 0.60% |

<Tip>
  Your fee tier is automatically calculated based on your monthly transaction volume. Higher volumes = lower fees!

## Fee FAQs
