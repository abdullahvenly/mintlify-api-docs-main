    1. Tap **Enter a setup key** instead
    2. Enter the account name: "FundFlowManager"
    3. Copy the secret key shown below the QR code

    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Backup Your 2FA

<Warning>
  **Important**: Save your 2FA secret key in a secure location. If you lose access to your authenticator device, you'll need this key to recover your account.
</Warning>

### 3. Test Transaction
