## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

### Why 2FA Matters

2FA protects your account even if someone obtains your password. They would also need access to your physical device.

### Setting Up 2FA

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download Authenticator App">
    Install Google Authenticator from:
    - [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/google-authenticator/id388497605)
    - [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Scan QR Code">
    During registration, scan the QR code with your authenticator app
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save Backup Code">
    Store your 2FA secret key securely (not on the same device)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Setup">
    Enter the 6-digit code to confirm setup
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2FA Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Backup Your 2FA**: Save the secret key in a password manager or secure location. Without it, you'll lose account access if your device is lost.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  **Never Share Your 2FA Code**: Support will never ask for your 2FA code. Sharing it compromises your account security.
</Warning>

## Account Security

### Password Best Practices

Create a strong password that:

‚úÖ **Good Practices:**
- Is at least 8 characters long (12+ recommended)
- Combines uppercase and lowercase letters
- Includes numbers and special characters
- Is unique (not used elsewhere)
- Is stored in a password manager

‚ùå **Avoid:**
- Common words or phrases
- Personal information (birthdays, names)
- Sequential numbers (123456)
- Reusing passwords from other sites
- Sharing with anyone

### Email Security

Your email is the primary recovery method:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use a Secure Email">
    Use a business email with 2FA enabled
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor for Suspicious Activity">
    Watch for unexpected verification emails
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Email Links">
    Always check sender address before clicking links
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Transaction Security

### Bank Account Verification

We verify bank accounts through email to ensure:

- You own the account you're adding
- Account details are correct
- Unauthorized accounts aren't added

<Info>
  Email verification typically takes a few minutes. Check your inbox and spam folder.
</Info>

### Wallet Verification

For external wallets (MetaMask, etc.), we require ownership proof:

**Verification Process:**
1. Enter your wallet address
2. Send exactly 1 USDC to our verification address
3. Transaction confirms on blockchain
4. Wallet is activated

<Warning>
  Only send the verification transaction from the wallet you're registering. Sending from a different wallet will fail verification.
</Warning>

## Recognizing Phishing Attempts

Protect yourself from scams:

### Legitimate Communication

‚úÖ **Official Channels:**
