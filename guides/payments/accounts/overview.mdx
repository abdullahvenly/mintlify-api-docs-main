  </Card>
  <Card title="Crypto Wallets" icon="wallet">
    Create or connect crypto wallets for digital asset transactions
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Why Add Accounts?

You need both bank accounts and crypto wallets to use the platform:

- **On-Ramp**: Transfer from bank account → crypto wallet
- **Off-Ramp**: Transfer from crypto wallet → bank account

<Info>
  Add and verify your accounts before creating transactions. Both types must be verified to process payments.

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Start Small**: Add one bank account and one wallet first. Test with a small transaction before adding more.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use Descriptive Names**: Name accounts by purpose (e.g., "Payroll USDC" or "Operating Expenses Bank")
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Verify Immediately**: Complete verification as soon as you add an account to avoid delays later
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Only add accounts you own and control. Adding unauthorized accounts may result in account suspension.
