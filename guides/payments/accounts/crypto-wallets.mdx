  <Step title="Configure">
    - **Name**: e.g., "Treasury USDC"
    - **Type**: Business/Treasury/Payout
    - **Network**: Polygon (recommended for low fees), Ethereum, Avalanche, BSC, Arbitrum, Optimism

  <Step title="Create">

  </Step>
</Steps>

**Benefits:** Instant activation, Venly manages security, no private key management

## Whitelisting Your Wallet

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate">
    **Accounts** → **Wallets** → **Whitelist Wallet**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter Details">
    - **Name**: Descriptive name
    - **Address**: 0x... (40 characters)
    - **Network**: Must match wallet's network
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Ownership">
    Send exactly 1 USDC to the verification address shown - **from the wallet you're registering**
    
    Wait 5-15 minutes for confirmation
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Benefits:** You control private keys, can use hardware wallets

<Warning>
  Must send from the exact wallet address you're registering. Wrong address = failed verification
</Warning>

| **Ethereum** | $5-$50 | Slower | Large amounts |
| **Avalanche** | $0.50-$2 | Very fast | Efficiency |
| **BSC** | $0.20-$1 | Fast | Cost-effective |

## Supported Assets

**Stablecoins:** USDC, USDT, DAI, FRAX

## Managing Wallets

- View balances in Accounts page
- Copy addresses
- View transaction history
- Remove wallets (if no pending transactions)

<Tip>
  Have wallets on multiple networks for flexibility
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

**Verification not completing?**
- Sent exactly 1 USDC? (not more, not less)
- From the wallet you're registering?
- Correct network? (e.g., Polygon USDC vs Ethereum USDC)
- Waited 15 minutes?

**Wrong network selected?** Remove and re-add with correct network

## Security

<Warning>
  **Never share** private keys or seed phrases. Venly will never ask for them.
</Warning>

**For Managed Wallets:** Protected by your account 2FA

**For External Wallets:** Use hardware wallets for large amounts, never enter keys on untrusted sites
