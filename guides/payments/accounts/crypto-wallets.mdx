    - Choose a descriptive name
    
    **Wallet Address**
    - Your wallet's public address
    - Format: 0x followed by 40 characters

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Start with Managed Wallets**: Use Venly-managed wallets first to test the platform before adding external wallets.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Multiple Networks**: Have wallets on different networks for flexibility. Polygon for high-volume, Ethereum for large amounts.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Clear Naming**: Name wallets by purpose: "USDC Operations", "ETH Treasury", "Customer Payments"
</Tip>

<Warning>
  **Never Share Private Keys**: If using external wallets, never share private keys, seed phrases, or recovery phrases with anyone.
</Warning>

## Security Best Practices

### For Managed Wallets
- Keep account 2FA enabled
- Use strong account password
- Monitor transaction notifications
- Review activity regularly

### For External Wallets
- Use hardware wallets for large amounts
- Store private keys offline
- Never enter keys on untrusted sites
- Enable all available security features
- Keep wallet software updated
