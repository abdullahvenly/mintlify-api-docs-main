## Account Statuses

| Status | Meaning | Actions Available |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| **PENDING** | Awaiting verification | Wait for review |
| **VERIFIED** | Ready to use | Can be used in ramp requests |
| **DENIED** | Verification failed | Review details and resubmit |

## Supported Ramp Types

When creating a bank account, specify which operations it supports:

- **ON_RAMP**: Can receive fiat deposits (for buying crypto)
- **OFF_RAMP**: Can send fiat withdrawals (for selling crypto)
- **ON_AND_OFF_RAMP**: Supports both operations

<Tip>
  Use descriptive names for your accounts like "EUR SEPA - Operations" or "Main Treasury Wallet" to easily identify them when creating ramp requests.

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Prepare Accounts Early**: Add and verify your bank accounts and wallets during your company onboarding process, before you need to create ramp requests.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Multiple Accounts**: You can add multiple bank accounts and wallets to support different currencies and use cases.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  **Security**: Never share private keys or seed phrases. Fundflow only needs your wallet address for verification.
</Warning>
