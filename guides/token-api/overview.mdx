<Info>
**Venly Token API** empowers users to create and manage custom ERC20 token contracts across Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains with enterprise-grade security and ease of use.
</Info>

## What is the Token API?

Venly's Token-API empowers users to create and manage custom ERC20 token contracts across Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains. The API allows businesses to deploy ERC20 contracts by defining parameters such as the token's name, symbol, supply cap, and owner.

Once deployed, users can mint tokens to multiple wallets, track the status of token deployments and mints, and manage existing contracts. This API offers an accessible solution for businesses looking to launch cryptocurrencies, manage tokenized assets, or build blockchain-based applications.

Venly's Token-API is a powerful tool that lowers the barriers to entry for businesses and developers looking to harness the potential of blockchain technology. With a focus on **ease of use**, **security**, and **flexibility**, this API empowers you to quickly create and mint ERC20 tokens, supporting various innovative blockchain use cases.
