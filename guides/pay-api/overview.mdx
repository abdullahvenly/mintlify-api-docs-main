<Info>
**Venly PAY API** enables seamless fiat payments for NFTs through Stripe integration, making it easy for your users to purchase digital assets with traditional currencies.
</Info>

## What is PAY?

Venly has partnered with **Stripe** to bring you **PAY**, an API payment gateway that allows our customers to create **Stripe** payment links to sell and purchase NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens).

This collaboration is part of a limited beta program, granting exclusive access to partners enabling NFT sales.

**PAY** makes onboarding easy and integrates you with **Stripe** so your users can sell or purchase NFTs in **fiat currency** (US Dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), British Pound (GBP), etc).

## What Does PAY Do?

### 1. Easy Onboarding & Integration with Stripe

Traditional Stripe clients cannot use Stripe Payments for NFTs due to the complex and lengthy process. Stripe rejects most applications for NFT use cases due to compliance issues.

**Venly** has partnered with **Stripe**, assuring you of a fully compliant and trusted payment solution.

Our streamlined **Know Your Business** (KYB) process simplifies the onboarding of clients, making it easier for them to use Stripe payments.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Onboarding Process">
    The onboarding process with PAY includes:
    
    - **PAY Onboarding Form** - Initial application
    - **Stripe Form** - Business and payment details
    - **Know Your Business (KYB) Form** - Compliance verification
    
    <Check>
    If accepted, you will receive the credentials and can start using PAY to create Stripe checkout links for your end-users.
    </Check>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Benefits">
    **Why Choose PAY over Direct Stripe:**
    
    - **Simplified Compliance** - Lightweight KYB process
    - **NFT-Specific Approval** - Pre-approved for NFT transactions
    - **Faster Onboarding** - Streamlined application process
    - **Expert Support** - Dedicated compliance management
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Create Stripe Checkout Links

With PAY, you can create Stripe checkout links for end-users of different NFT products. When creating the link, you can specify the **currency** of your choice (based on what currency your users want to pay in).

This allows your end-users the option to complete payments using various fiat currencies such as US Dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), British Pound (GBP), and more.

</AccordionGroup>

### 3. Customize Checkout Links

You have the flexibility to personalize the checkout links by incorporating your **company's logo** and adding your preferred **color scheme**.

## Why Not Use Stripe Directly?

<Warning>
**Challenges with Direct Stripe Integration:**
- Rigorous and time-consuming compliance process
- Complex NFT-specific requirements
- High rejection rate for NFT applications
- Lengthy approval times
- Complex integration requirements
</Warning>

<Tip>
**PAY Advantages:**
- **Fully Compliant** - Pre-approved for NFT transactions
- **Simplified Onboarding** - Lightweight KYB process
- **Expert Support** - Dedicated compliance management
- **Easy Integration** - Stripe Connect capabilities through documentation
- **Faster Approval** - Streamlined due diligence process
</Tip>

Our customers often face the burden of integrating our services with separate payment providers, leading to inefficiencies and complications.

**PAY** is fully compliant with Stripe and thus simplifies onboarding with our **lightweight KYB process**.

The PAY compliance manager carries out a due diligence process before onboarding a customer. This is rather straightforward and simpler compared to Stripe.
