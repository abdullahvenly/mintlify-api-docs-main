<Warning>
**Critical Warning**: Deleting a user will soft delete all their linked wallets. The wallets will no longer appear in any endpoints but can potentially be recovered. This action should be performed with extreme caution.
</Warning>

## Overview

User deletion is necessary for:
- **Account closure**: Removing users who no longer need access
- **Data compliance**: Meeting GDPR and other privacy regulations
- **Security incidents**: Immediately disabling compromised accounts
- **Business requirements**: Cleaning up inactive or test accounts

<Info>
User deletion is a soft delete operation, meaning the data is marked as deleted but not immediately purged from the system. This allows for potential recovery in emergency situations.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

Before deleting a user, ensure you have:
- A valid user ID for the account to be deleted
- A valid signing method from the user being deleted (for authentication)
- Confirmation that the user wants their account deleted
- Understanding of the impact on associated wallets and data

## Deletion Impact Assessment

<Steps>
<Step title="User Account">
The user account will be marked as deleted and become inaccessible.
</Step>

<Step title="Associated Wallets">
All wallets linked to the user will be soft deleted and hidden from endpoints.
</Step>

<Step title="Signing Methods">
All authentication methods for the user will be deactivated.
</Step>

<Step title="Transaction History">
Historical transaction data remains for audit purposes but becomes inaccessible.
</Step>
</Steps>

## API Reference

### Endpoint
```http
DELETE /api/users/{userId}
```

### Headers

| Header | Format | Description | Example |
|--------|--------|-------------|---------|
| `Signing-Method` | `id:value` | Authentication using user's signing method | `756ae7a7-3713-43ee-9936-0dff50306488:123456` |

<Warning>
The signing method must belong to the user being deleted. This ensures that only the user themselves (or authorized parties with their credentials) can delete the account.
</Warning>

| `userId` | Path | The unique ID of the user to delete | âœ… | `"5f23aff6-6786-4160-b5cb-8f65c79eec17"` |

## Code Examples

## Response Format

### Success Response

```json User Deletion Success
{
  "success": true
}
```

### Response Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `success` | Boolean indicating successful deletion |

<Tip>
A successful response confirms that the user and all associated data have been marked for deletion. The process is immediate and irreversible through normal API operations.

## Pre-Deletion Checklist

Before proceeding with user deletion, consider these important steps:

<Accordion title="Pre-Deletion Verification Steps">

**1. Confirm User Intent**
- Verify the user actually wants their account deleted
- Ensure they understand the consequences
- Document the deletion request for compliance

**2. Backup Critical Data**
- Export any important wallet information if needed
- Save transaction history for records
- Document any business-critical information

**3. Check Wallet Balances**
- Ensure all wallets have zero or acceptable balances
- Transfer any remaining assets to other wallets
- Verify no pending transactions exist

**4. Notify Stakeholders**
- Inform relevant team members
- Update any external systems that reference the user
- Log the deletion for audit purposes

**5. Compliance Considerations**
- Ensure deletion meets regulatory requirements
- Document the reason for deletion
- Follow company data retention policies

</Accordion>

## Error Handling

<Accordion title="Common Error Scenarios">

**User Not Found**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "errorCode": "USER_NOT_FOUND",
  "message": "User with the specified ID does not exist"
}
```

**Invalid Signing Method**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "errorCode": "INVALID_SIGNING_METHOD",
  "message": "The provided signing method is invalid or does not belong to this user"
}
```

**Authentication Failed**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "errorCode": "AUTHENTICATION_FAILED",
  "message": "Authentication failed. Please check your signing method credentials"
}
```

**User Already Deleted**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "errorCode": "USER_ALREADY_DELETED",
  "message": "This user account has already been deleted"
}
```

**Deletion Not Allowed**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "errorCode": "DELETION_NOT_ALLOWED",
  "message": "User deletion is not permitted due to active constraints"
}
```

</Accordion>

## Security Considerations

<Warning>
**Security Best Practices:**

1. **Verify Identity**: Always confirm the user's identity before deletion
2. **Use Proper Authentication**: Ensure the signing method belongs to the user
3. **Log All Deletions**: Maintain audit trails for compliance
4. **Implement Approval Workflows**: Consider requiring multiple approvals
5. **Monitor for Abuse**: Watch for unusual deletion patterns
6. **Secure Communication**: Use encrypted channels for deletion requests
</Warning>

## Data Recovery Options

### Soft Delete Nature
- User data is marked as deleted, not physically removed
- Recovery may be possible through support channels
- Time-limited recovery window (typically 30-90 days)

### Recovery Process
1. Contact Venly support immediately
2. Provide user ID and deletion timestamp
3. Justify the recovery request
4. Follow verification procedures

### Prevention Strategies
- Implement confirmation dialogs in your application
- Provide account deactivation as an alternative
- Offer data export before deletion
- Use staged deletion with grace periods

## Alternative to Deletion

Consider these alternatives before permanent deletion:

### Account Deactivation
- Temporarily disable the account
- Preserve data for potential reactivation
- Maintain compliance with data retention

### Data Archival
- Move user data to long-term storage
- Keep minimal information for legal requirements
- Implement automated purging after retention periods

## Best Practices

1. **Implement Confirmation Flows**: Require multiple confirmations
2. **Provide Clear Warnings**: Explain consequences to users
3. **Offer Alternatives**: Suggest account deactivation when appropriate
4. **Maintain Audit Logs**: Record all deletion activities
5. **Follow Compliance Rules**: Adhere to data protection regulations
6. **Test Deletion Flows**: Regularly verify the deletion process works correctly

## Integration Example

```javascript
async function deleteUserWithConfirmation(userId, signingMethodId, signingMethodValue) {
  // Step 1: Get user information for confirmation
  const userInfo = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
  const userData = await userInfo.json();
  
  if (!userData.success) {
    throw new Error('User not found');
  }
  
  // Step 2: Show confirmation to user
  const confirmed = await showDeletionConfirmation(userData.result);
  
  if (!confirmed) {
    return { cancelled: true };
  }
  
  // Step 3: Perform deletion
  const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`, {
    method: 'DELETE',
    headers: {
      'Signing-Method': `${signingMethodId}:${signingMethodValue}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
  });
  
  const result = await response.json();
  
  if (result.success) {
    // Log the deletion for audit purposes
    console.log(`User ${userId} deleted successfully at ${new Date().toISOString()}`);
  }
  
  return result;
}
```
