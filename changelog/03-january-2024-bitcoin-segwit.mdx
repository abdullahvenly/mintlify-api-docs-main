### Litecoin Segwit Address

### Spam Flag

Like other emerging technologies, ERC20 tokens and NFTs are attracting bad actors exploiting their novel features. To tackle this problem, we have introduced a `possibleSpam` flag which indicates whether or not an ERC20 token might be spam.

The following endpoints will include a `possibleSpam` boolean in the response bodies, and also a new query boolean parameter, `includePossibleSpam` which indicates whether or not to include the spam tokens in the response body.

**Affected Endpoints:**

- `GET /api/wallets/{walletId}/balance/tokens`
- `GET /api/wallets/{walletId}/balance/tokens/{token}`
- `GET /api/wallets/{secretType}/{walletAddress}/balance/tokens`
- `GET /api/wallets/{secretType}/{walletAddress}/balance/tokens/{token}`
- `GET /api/wallets/{walletId}/nonfungibles`
- `GET /api/wallets/nonfungibles`
- `GET /api/wallets/{secretType}/{walletAddress}/nonfungibles`

<Info>
The `possibleSpam` flag helps protect users from malicious tokens by identifying potentially dangerous assets before they interact with them.
