We've updated the **Widget** to version **2.3.0** which makes it a lot easier for developers to perform widget calls.

<Info>
To upgrade you only need to change a few lines of code.
</Info>

## What's New

In version 2.3.0, the pop-up window also changes. When a function is executed, a modal will appear first, after which the user can start the confirmation/approval flow.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="No Pop-up Blockers" icon="shield-check">
    Automatically handles pop-up blockers through modal triggering
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Simplified API" icon="code">
    Execute functions in one step instead of two
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Modal Flow" icon="window">
    New modal appears before confirmation flow
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Redirect Support" icon="arrow-right">
    Also supports redirect mode as alternative
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

By making this change, developers don't need to deal anymore with the hassle of pop up blockers, that is automatically being taking care of by the modal that is being triggered.

## New Widget Modal

The modal will trigger the pop-up, allowing your end-user to execute the required function.

### Redirect Mode Support

Note that version 2.3.0 also supported the redirect option where instead of triggering a pop-up window we redirect to user.

## Code Comparison

### Old Method (Deprecated but still working)

The old way requires **two steps**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Signer">
    First, creating a signer
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Execute Function">
    Second, executing the function call
  </Step>
</Steps>

```javascript
// Step#1 Create Signer
const signer = venlyConnect.createSigner();

// Step#2 Executing the function (Signing Message)
signer.signMessage({
    walletId: 'c8ec9954-fa1a-4682-9cf8-ef5c1015d1d1',
    secretType: 'ETHEREUM',
    data : "I agree with terms and conditions"
})
```

### New Method (v2.3.0)

With the **2.3.0** update, you can do this in just **one step**:

```javascript
// Execute the function in a single step

venlyConnect.signer.signMessage({
    walletId: 'c8ec9954-fa1a-4682-9cf8-ef5c1015d1d1',
    secretType: 'ETHEREUM',
    data : "I agree with terms and conditions"
})
```

<Info>
This new change applies to all the function calls which previously required to create a signer as a separate step.
