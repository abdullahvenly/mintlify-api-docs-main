We're updating how Ethereum contract operations are funded in the **NFT-API v3** and the **Token-API**.

From now on, contract deployments on Ethereum requires a funded company wallet for both NFT contracts and Token contracts.

Previously, Venly sponsored contract deployment costs automatically. Going forward, you will need to fund your Ethereum company wallet with at least **0.02 ETH** before deploying a contract. This ensures you have enough funds not only for the contract deployment but also to cover minting operations right after. Learn more below.
