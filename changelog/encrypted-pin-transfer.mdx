We are excited to introduce the **Encrypted PIN Transfer** feature, enhancing the security of transferring user PINs. It allows for secure PIN sharing without revealing the actual PIN, utilizing advanced encryption techniques. We have also added a **new security endpoint** which exposes the Venly public key used for encryption.

## Encrypted PIN Transfer

It allows you to transfer the end-users signing methods (PIN, Emergency Code, Biometrics) in a secure and encrypted way so that it is not visible on your system in any way. Your system won't be able to view or read the end-user signing method's value.

This feature also ensures that the original end-user request body is not tampered with and helps avoid duplicate transactions.

  <Accordion title="AES 256-bit Key Encryption" icon="shield-check">
    Ensures robust security by encrypting the signing method body with a random AES 256-bit key. Provides a high level of security, protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="RSA-2048 Public Key" icon="key">
    Uses the RSA-2048 public key from Venly's public endpoint to encrypt the AES key. It adds an extra layer of security by using the Venly public key.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="SHA256 Hashing" icon="hashtag">
    Implements SHA256 hashing for the request body. Ensures that the data has not been tampered with, maintaining the integrity of the information being transferred.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Base64 Encoding" icon="code">
    Applies base64 encoding for secure data transmission in headers. Simplifies data transmission, ensuring that the encrypted data can be safely sent over the network.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Idempotency Key" icon="fingerprint">
    This unique UUID prevents your application from submitting the same request multiple times without the end user's consent. Helps avoid duplicate transactions, ensuring that each request is processed only once.
