In the coming weeks, Goerli testnet will be deprecated on Ethereum and Arbitrum. We will **migrate on the 15th of December** from Goerli to Sepolia on both Ethereum and Arbitrum.

Sepolia was a proof-of-authority testnet created in October 2021 by Ethereum core developers and maintained ever since. Sepolia was designed to simulate harsh network conditions, and has shorter block times, which enable faster transaction confirmation times and feedback for developers.

## Timeline

<Warning>
**15th of December**: Switch from Goerli to Sepolia Testnet
</Warning>

## Impact

In general all of our systems will remain operational, and all changes needed will happen in the background, no code changes are required to make use of the Sepolia testnet work on Ethereum and Arbitrum.

As we are switching to a different testnet network that also means that all existing objects on the current Goerli will not exist on the Sepolia network. Therefore we will purge the data in the Sandbox environment. Below is described per API product what that means.
