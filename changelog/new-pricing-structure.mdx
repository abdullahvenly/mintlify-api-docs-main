Venly has changed its pricing structure from product-based to **platform-based subscriptions**. Now you can access all API products and SDKs with a single subscription. The first subscription plan (_Professional Plan_) comes with a free 14-day trial and access to all products in Staging and Production. More subscription plans coming soon.

## Get access to everything - With one subscription!

We have moved to a platform-based subscription where you get access to all API products and SDKs in staging and production.

The very first plan is the **Professional Plan** which comes with a 14-day trial after which you will be billed. This plan gives you access to everything on staging/production and includes **1 Million compute units monthly**.

Each endpoint you use consumes some compute units. The [usage](https://portal.venly.io/usage) section includes details on:

- Total number of API calls
- Total number of compute units used
- Total number of errors (_user-side + client-side_)

### Billing Details

- The **Professional plan** starts at **$199/month** if billed **annually**, or at **$249** if billed **monthly**
- The Professional plan comes with 1 Million compute units monthly
- In the Professional plan, compute units are conveniently bundled in groups of 100K. This means, your Professional plan includes ten such bundles, each containing 100K compute units
- Should you exceed the compute unit limit on your plan (_for instance, 1 Million_), an additional bundle of 100K compute units will be automatically added and invoiced by **$25**. If you surpass this extra 100K compute units, another 100K compute units will be added and invoiced, and so on. This ensures uninterrupted service while keeping you informed about your usage
- The 14-day trial only applies to users who have not availed a trial before. The trial also gives you access to all staging/production products
- All legacy product-based subscription plans have been **removed**
- The developer portal represents all legacy plans as **Custom Plan**
