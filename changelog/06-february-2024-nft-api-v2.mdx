## Why v1.0 is Being Deprecated

**NFT API v1** is being deprecated to make way for significant improvements and new features introduced in **NFT API v2.0**. Deprecating the older version allows us to focus on providing a more robust, efficient, and feature-rich experience for you.

<Warning>
Please note that continuing to use **NFT API v1.0** will result in missing out on valuable features. We highly recommend [migrating](https://docs.venly.io/docs/migration-guide-for-nft-api) to **NFT API v2.0** at your earliest convenience.
</Warning>

<Info>
**NOTE**: We will continue to support the **NFT API v1.0**. Meaning a migration is not a must, but we do highly recommend it.
