### 1. Create ERC20 Token Contracts

Easily deploy an ERC20 token contract on the supported blockchains:
- Matic
- Ethereum
- Binance Smart Chain
- Avalanche
- Arbitrum

**Customizable Parameters:**
- **Token Name**: Set a custom name for your token
- **Symbol**: Choose an optional symbol for your token
- **Max Supply**: Set an optional limit on the number of ERC20 tokens that can be minted
- **Burnable Tokens**: Define whether tokens can be burned (removed from circulation)
- **Owner Rights**: Assign administrative rights to a specific wallet address

### 2. Check Contract Deployment Status

Track the progress of your token contract deployment using the **deployment ID** returned from the token contract creation request.

**Status Updates:**
- `SUCCEEDED`: The contract is successfully deployed
- `PENDING`: The contract is being deployed
- `FAILED`: The contract deployment encountered an error

### 3. Mint ERC20 Tokens

Mint tokens directly from your deployed ERC20 contract by specifying the contract address and the recipient wallet addresses. Supports minting tokens for multiple wallets in a single API call.

### 4. Track Token Minting Status

Monitor the status of your token minting requests using the **mint ID**.

**Status Updates:**
- `SUCCEEDED`: The tokens were minted and sent successfully
- `PENDING`: The minting request is being processed
- `FAILED`: The minting process encountered an error

### 5. Manage Token Contracts

- Retrieve all your token contracts
- Retrieve token contracts by chain and token contract address
- Delete token contracts

## Testing

### Sandbox Environment

All API interactions can be conducted in the sandbox environment, allowing developers to experiment and test without affecting live blockchain data or assets.

### Flexible API Usage

- **API Reference**: Execute API calls directly through the Venly API Reference
- **Postman Integration**: Use Postman to send requests and test API calls easily

## Gasless ERC20 Transfers

Gasless transactions for ERC-20 tokens offer a seamless way to send ERC20 tokens without spending gas fees yourself. This feature allows users to authorize an ERC20 token transfer via a signed message, allowing someone else to cover the gas costs.
