## UI/UX Improvements

- General UI/UX improvements throughout.
- Separate graph for compute unit usage and for API requests and errors.

- Testnet names were added to the faucet page.
- New users who complete the onboarding will arrive on sandbox screens. (_ you can switch between sandbox and production using the toggle from the top right_)
- New users who complete onboarding or sign up for a new plan will see a textbox informing them of testnet assets that are automatically created for them.

## Miscellaneous Changes

- You can now create a maximum of 10 companies.

## Downgrading Plan

- You can only upgrade your billing cycle or subscription plan from the Portal. (i.e. _upgrading from monthly to yearly billing, or upgrading to a higher tier plan_)
- If you wish to downgrade to a lower-tier plan or downgrade the billing cycle using the same plan, you must [contact support](mailto:support@venly.io) or reach out via chat from the [Portal](https://portal.venly.io/) (_click on the message icon on the bottom right_).
