We're thrilled to introduce a major improvement to our onboarding process: automatic **Platform Trial** activation. This update is designed to make it easier than ever for new users to explore the full potential of our platform without any upfront commitment. A new integrations section is added to the Portal that includes all the integrations in one place.

## Onboarding made Fast!

**Streamlined Onboarding**: When you sign up or create a new company, a **14-day Platform Trial** is automatically activated.

**Instant Access to Services**: You immediately get access to the Portal and all sandbox/production services. 

**Platform Trial**: This plan includes all the features that are on the **Developer Plan**. Read more about [subscription plans](https://www.venly.io/pricing) and included features.

**No Upfront Payment Required**: Users can explore all features without needing to enter credit card details during the trial period.

**End of Trial**: After 14 days, the Trial plan ends automatically. Users will then be prompted to select a plan if they wish to continue using the platform.

## New Integrations Section

The Integrations section serves as a centralized hub for all **Venly integrations**, making managing and exploring them in one place easy. Each integration is listed with a brief description to help you quickly identify its purpose and capabilities.

Selecting an integration lets you access detailed information about its features, use cases, and setup requirements. Additionally, each integration includes a direct link to a comprehensive **Getting Started Guide**, providing step-by-step instructions to help you implement the integration seamlessly.
