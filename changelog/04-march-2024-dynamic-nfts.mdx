## Introducing Dynamic NFTs âš¡

### 1. Introduction

- Venly proudly presents **Dynamic NFTs**, which allows creators and collectors to engage with digital assets dynamically and personally
- **Dynamic NFTs** transcend traditional non-fungible tokens, allowing the NFT to change or evolve over time
- This dynamic nature introduces a level of interactivity and uniqueness that sets them apart from static NFTs

### 2. Metadata Magic

- Dynamic NFTs now support metadata updates on the token level
- Each minted NFT's metadata can be updated, added, and deleted individually, providing unprecedented customization

### 3. Token-Level Independence

- Token-type retains metadata defined during creation; changes at the token level do not impact the original token-type

### 4. Token-type Metadata

- Modifying the metadata of the token-type after minting an NFT will not impact the already minted NFTs
- The changes will only be applied to newly minted NFTs under that specific token-type

### 5. Attribute Fusion

- Users can dynamically alter the `type, name, value, and maximum value` of attributes
- Multiple attributes can be defined at both token-type and token levels
- The **token attributes** merge with the **attributes** defined on the **token-type level**

### 6. Properties & animationUrls

- Properties, including `Name, Description, External URL, Image, Background Color`, support dynamic changes
- Properties defined on the token level override token-type properties
- `animationUrls`, presented as a single array, can be dynamically changed at the token level
- Changes to `animationUrls` on the token level override those defined on the token-type level
