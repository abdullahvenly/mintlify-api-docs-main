We're excited to introduce new enhancements to the **Venly Developer Portal**, simplifying **NFT management** and **PAY** webhook configurationâ€”no manual API calls required. You can now **create and deploy NFT contracts**, **create token types**, and **mint tokens** directly from the portal interface. Additionally, we've made it easier to configure, edit, and delete PAY API webhooks. These updates provide a seamless experience for non-developers.
